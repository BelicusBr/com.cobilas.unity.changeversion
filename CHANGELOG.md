and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
## [2.1.3] (12/02/2024)
- ### Fixed
- - Fixed an issue in the `UpdateClosedOption` class that caused it to work randomly.
- - #### Details
- - - The `UpdateClosedOption` class used the `EditorApplication.quitting` event, which was called when the Unity editor closed. However, this event was called before all other classes were finished, which caused the `UpdateClosedOption` class to malfunction.
- - #### Solution
- - - The `UpdateClosedOption` class now uses the `EditorApplication.wantsToQuit` event, which is called before the Unity editor quits. This allows the `UpdateClosedOption` class to finish correctly before the editor is closed.

## [2.1.2] (11/02/2024)
- ### Fixed
- - Fixed an issue in the `UpdateBuildOption` class that prevented it from being called correctly in the project post-build.
- - #### Details
- - - The `UpdateBuildOption` class inherited the `IPostprocessBuildWithReport` interface, which allowed it to be called after the project was built.
However, the Unity editor was calling and instantiating the `UpdateBuildOption` class instead of using the already instantiated object.
This caused the class to malfunction.
- - #### Solution
- - - The `IPostprocessBuildWithReport` interface has been removed from the `UpdateBuildOption` class.
Now, the `UpdateBuildOption` class uses the `OnPostprocessBuild` event of the `CVBuildReport` class, which is correctly called after the project is built.
